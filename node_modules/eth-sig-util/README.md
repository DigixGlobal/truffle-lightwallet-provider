A small collection of ethereum signing functions.

[Available on NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eth-sig-util)

## Installation

```

## Methods

### concatSig(v, r, s)

All three arguments should be provided as buffers.

Returns a continuous, hex-prefixed hex value for the signature, suitable for inclusion in a JSON transaction's data field.

### normalize(address)

Takes an address of either upper or lower case, with or without a hex prefix, and returns an all-lowercase, hex-prefixed address, suitable for submitting to an ethereum provider.

### personalSign (privateKeyBuffer, msgParams)

msgParams should have a `data` key that is hex-encoded data to sign.

Returns the prefixed signature expected for calls to `eth.personalSign`.

### recoverPersonalSignature (msgParams)

msgParams should have a `data` key that is hex-encoded data unsigned, and a `sig` key that is hex-encoded and already signed.

Returns a hex-encoded sender address.
